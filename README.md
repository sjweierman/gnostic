# Gnostic Notes
## An interfaith study tool for engaging sacred texts.

The aim of this project is to provide an AI-powered, interreligious study tool for engaging with those texts that have held deep meaning for faith communities through the ages. Drawing inspiration from both modern Bible study apps and the *Zettelkasten* note-taking method, this will provide all the common tools and resources one might find there: customizable hyperlinks across resources, dynamic note-taking, multi-language dictionaries, and concordances. This project will incorporate a large language model (LLM) to aid in drawing meaningful thematic connections within and across texts.

It is my fervent hope that this project may help foster deeper understanding across traditions and communities.
